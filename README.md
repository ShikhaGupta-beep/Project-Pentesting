# Project-Pentesting
  This Project is about Offensive Security where a fictional organization,Rekall Corporation is attacked and its vulnerabilities has been uncovered. 
  
  Brief about the organisation:
    
    Rekall Corporation is a fictional company that specializes in offering virtual reality experiences based on images that customers upload.
    These experiences could include dream vacations, adventures, or even secret missions. Rekall guarantees that these virtual reality 
    experiences will feel real.
    Rekall is about to go live with their business, and they need penetration testers to find any vulnerabilities within their technical systems.
    Rekall has a brand new web application and several Windows and Linux servers that manage their businesses.
  
  
  This Project is divided into three parts where
  
      Part 1: The fictional organization's web application that has a variety of vulnerabilities were exploited using various techniques like 
      Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection commands.
      Part 2: The fictional organization's Linux servers and vulnerabilities related to Linux operating systems was exploited.
      Part 3: The fictional organization's Windows servers and vulnerabilities related to Windows operating systems was exploited.
      
   Lab Environment used:
   
      The Project lab environment was located in Windows Azure Lab Services and to access this environment,
      RDP into the Windows RDP Host machine. 
      Hyper-V Manager was used to access the nested machine (Kali and Windowa 10).
      
      
A detailed Pentesting Report has been generated and attached in this project as a deliverable which descibes in details about the vulneraibilities and various mitigation strategies.
